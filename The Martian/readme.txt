Journey To Mars
---------------
This Java coding assignment will introduce students to how software projects are (often) run in the real world. Specifically, the student will leverage his/her current programming skills to understand, troubleshoot, and modify an existing piece of software (ah, yes…the joys of working with someone else’s code!). Over the course of this assignment, the student will be given a series of tasks. Many of these tasks will originate from requests by the end user. As the student will soon see, the end user is mostly concerned with “the what”, and less so with “the how” (or “the why”). Hence, many of these tasks will lack sufficient technical detail, and it will be up to the student to fill in the gaps. Students should take their time, think before they code, and shouldn't be afraid to ask questions. Good luck to students and teachers!

Installation:
-------------
Unzip the contents of the zip archive. The following files and folders are provided:

Student 				Folder containing student source code (see note below)
Teacher					Folder containing teacher source code (see note below)
readme.txt				This document
Journey To Mars.docx	The student assignment
threetenbp-1.3.1.jar	Required external JAVA package

NOTE: There are two folders included with this lesson: "Student" and "Teacher". The "Teacher" folder contains all of the source code that is provided in the "Student" folder; plus it includes "MyJourneyToMars.java", "MyMission.java", and "MyOrbit.java" which encompass overloaded functions that represent the "answer key" for the student exercises.

Required External Libraries:
----------------------------
To ensure compatibility with Java 7, this project requires that the  ThreeTen Java SE 7 Backport is installed. The associated jar file is named "threetenbp-1.3.1.jar" and is included with the source files for this project. To use this package, it must be added to the  libraries accessed by your IDE.

For the BlueJ IDE, copy "threetenbp-1.3.1.jar" to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\BlueJ\lib\userlib" directory. Alternatively, in BlueJ, click "Tools | Preferences | Libraries". Click "Add", then browse to the current location of "threetenbp-1.3.1.jar". NOTE: BlueJ will need to be restarted before these changes take effect.

For Eclipse, open the Properties dialog for the project. Select "Java Build Path" from the leftmost list. Select the "Libraries" tab. Click "Add External JARs..." and browse to the current location of "threetenbp-1.3.1.jar".
